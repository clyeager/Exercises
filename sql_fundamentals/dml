CREATE TABLE parts (

INSERT INTO devices (name)

INSERT INTO parts (part_number, device_id)
VALUES (1, 1),
       (2, 1),

SELECT devices.name, parts.part_number FROM devices
    INNER JOIN parts ON devices.id = parts.device_id
    ORDER BY name, part_number;

4.
SELECT id, part_number, device_id FROM parts WHERE part_number::text LIKE '3%';

5.
SELECT devices.name, count(parts.id) FROM devices
    LEFT OUTER JOIN parts ON devices.id = parts.device_id
    GROUP BY devices.name;

6.
SELECT devices.name, count(parts.id) FROM devices
    LEFT OUTER JOIN parts ON devices.id = parts.device_id
    GROUP BY devices.name ORDER BY devices.name DESC;

7.
SELECT part_number, device_id FROM parts
    WHERE device_id IS NOT NULL;

SELECT part_number, device_id FROM parts
    WHERE device_id IS NULL;

8.
INSERT INTO devices (name) VALUES ('Magnetometer');
INSERT INTO parts (part_number, device_id) VALUES (12, 3);

SELECT name FROM devices ORDER BY id LIMIT 1;

9.
UPDATE parts SET device_id = 1 WHERE id = 11 OR id = 12;

Further Exploration:
UPDATE parts SET device_id = 2
WHERE part_number = (SELECT min(part_number) FROM parts);

10.
DELETE FROM parts WHERE device_id = 1;
DELETE FROM devices WHERE name = 'Accelerometer';

Further Exploration: We could make a constraint on the device_id by using ON DELETE CASCADE so 
the parts would be deleted if the associated primary key (device) were deleted.

ALTER TABLE parts
DROP CONSTRAINT parts_device_id_fkey,
ADD CONSTRAINT parts_device_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY(device_id) REFERENCES devices(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
DELETE FROM devices WHERE id=1;
