#The problem is that the File class does not have a FORMAT constant and it can not
#use the constants of its subclasses because they are not in lexical scope.
#We would need to take out the to_s method in File and move to each of the subclasses.
#We could also choose to use a method instead or change the to_s in the File class
#to "#{name}.#{self.class::FORMAT}".
